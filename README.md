Finance KPI Dashboard Project
This project focuses on the development of a Finance KPI Dashboard using Power BI, designed to monitor and evaluate key financial metrics within an organization. The dashboard provides actionable insights into the performance of sales teams and individual employees, enabling stakeholders to track progress towards financial goals.

The project involved several core processes, including:

Data Cleansing and Data Modeling:
I started by cleaning and structuring the raw data using Power Query, which involved removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis. From there, I built a data model to ensure relationships between different datasets were correctly established, making the data ready for efficient reporting.

DAX Calculations:
To generate insightful metrics, I created DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) calculations that helped derive key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and financial figures. These DAX calculations were crucial in computing the following metrics:

Total Sales (Actual): The sum of actual sales achieved over a specific period.
Total Targeted Sales: The total sales goal set for that period.
Year-to-Date (YTD) Actual and Target: Cumulative actual sales and target sales up to the current date.
Variance: The difference between actual sales and targeted sales, showing whether the company is exceeding or falling short of its goals.
Variance Percentage: The percentage difference between actual and targeted sales, which provides a clear measure of performance relative to the target.
Performance Insights:
One of the key features of this dashboard is its ability to analyze the frequency with which monthly sales targets were met. This performance view allows users to track how each employee performed over time by comparing their actual sales against targeted sales on a monthly basis. By visualizing this data, it becomes easier to identify high-performers and those who may need additional support.

Team-Wise Selection and Salesperson Metrics:
The dashboard includes a team-wise selection filter, offering users the flexibility to drill down into the performance of specific sales teams. This enables deeper analysis by team, with key metrics displayed for each salesperson, such as:

Actual Sales
Target Sales
Variance and Variance Percentage
Sales Trend Analysis
These visualizations help provide a comprehensive view of individual and team performance, enabling data-driven decision-making by identifying trends and patterns in sales behavior over time.

Technology and Tools:
Power BI: Used for creating the interactive dashboard, building data models, and designing visuals.
Power Query: Utilized for data cleansing and transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
DAX: Employed for complex calculations and creating meaningful insights from the raw data.
Impact of the Dashboard:
This project highlights my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and financial reporting. The dashboard not only tracks KPIs but also helps stakeholders understand how well sales targets are being met at both the employee and team level. By analyzing variance and trends, users can quickly spot areas of improvement and make more informed business decisions.

The dashboardâ€™s interactive features ensure that users can easily filter data, focus on specific salespeople or teams, and monitor performance metrics with ease.
